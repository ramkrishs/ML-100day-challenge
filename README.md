# 100-Day Machine Learning Challenge

Welcome to my 100-Day Machine Learning Challenge! This repository documents my journey as I dedicate time each day to learning and applying machine learning concepts.

## Goal

The primary goal of this challenge is to build a strong foundation in machine learning by working on hands-on projects, exploring various datasets, and implementing algorithms from scratch.

## Log

*   **Day 1:** [Explore Indian Food Dataset](./day-01/README.md) - Initial data exploration, cleaning, and preparation of several Indian food recipe datasets.
